# About me


**Braden-Beers/Braden-Beers** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-  I am currently learning python, c#, SQL, and Sap.
-  Ask me what I Learned today
-  if you want to reach me email BradenBeers@yahoo.com
- Fun fact is I feel like im drowning in learning all of these programming languages
